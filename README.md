# Weather (job) application

[Etch](https://etch.co) is hiring a [full-stack developer](https://etch.co/jobs/full-stack-developer)!

## Code challenge

The best way to understand a developer is through their code.

We'd like you to set up a simple weather app to display todays weather.

### Requirements

- Fork this repo and submit a PR when you're done. A few notes about the how's and why's would be great.
- Use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the app base.
- Mask the third party API calls by using a [Next.js API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
- Use [IPInfo](https://ipinfo.io/) to get the user's location.
- Use [MET Norway Weather API](https://api.met.no/) to get the weather data.
- Display todays weather on the page any way you like.

### Tips

- The available clients for the weather API seems to be outdated and do not work. Use the API directly.
- Use something like [localhost.run](https://localhost.run/) to get a real remote IP for IPInfo.
